## ChequePic
Biometric security banking solutions 

## Intro
**ChequePic** is a revolutionary app designed to be offered for banks to implement. Users are able to upload photos to be linked to their accounts. For any banking activity (withdrawing money, transferring money, authorizing decisions), they will be asked to take a series of selfies to verify they have the authorization to make these decisions. 

We make use of multiple APIs and functions:  
+ "Set Database" Function -> database of reference pictures of who can use the account
+ Microsoft Azure Face API -> facial recognition and verification
+ STDLib Messagebird API -> informs the account holder of any activity

## Build & Run
To build the project, first install all relevant packages using pip:
+ lib (from STDlib)
+ cognitive_face (from Microsoft Azure)
+ requests
+ urllib3
+ Pillow
